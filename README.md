# polymarket-ai-analysis
Developing an AI-assisted tool to analyse Polymarket prediction market bets. The project explores how modern AI can support probabilistic decision-making by combining publicly available information, recent data, and sentiment to assess the likelihood of outcomes in contemporary markets.


# AI-Assisted Market Decision Tool

This project explores how modern AI tools can be used to support probabilistic decision-making
in prediction markets, using Polymarket as a case study.

## Motivation
AI is increasingly influential in modern finance and decision-making. This project investigates
how publicly available information and AI-assisted analysis can be combined to assess the likelihood
of outcomes in prediction markets.

## Current Status
This project is in early development. Current work focuses on:
- Structuring prediction market data
- Exploring relevant external signals
- Experimenting with AI-assisted reasoning

## Future Directions
- Integrating data sources
- Refining probability estimates
- Comparing AI-assisted predictions with market-implied probabilities
